- TRUE
- FALSE
- OR
- AND
- NOT
- XOR
- IF  
- IFERROR

- SWITCH 

## Logical Functions
In this section, you will learn about each of these logical functions through various scenarios.

### TRUE and FALSE Functions
We use the `TRUE` and `FALSE` functions when we want to showcase if a given condition is met or not. For instance, `5 < 3` is a right condition hence the `TRUE` function when used with the `IF` function (or similar) returns a `TRUE` value. Had the condition been wrong it would had resulted in the `FALSE` value.

Notice, that `TRUE` function is not the same as the `TRUE` value. The `TRUE` function doesn't hold any argument inside the round brackets.
We will give you a scenario to implement these funcitons when we are discussing `IF` function.

### OR Function
A logical `OR` function follows the given truth table:
