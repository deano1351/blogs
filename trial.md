- IFERROR 
- AND 
- FALSE 
- IFNA 
- IFS

## Logical Functions
Now we will start learning how logical functions can be used to make our work easy through examples:


### IF Function
IF function checks whether the given condition is met or not. In case condition is met, it returns `TRUE` otherwise it will return `FALSE`.

Let's consider a very basic example where you need to compare two numbers whether they are equal or not. In case they are equal, IF function should return `TRUE` else `FALSE`.

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| 4 | 5 |

Here we have a value for each column A  and B respectively. we need to check whether they are equal or not.If they are equal it should return TRUE else FALSE.
