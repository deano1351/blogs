## Introduction
In this guide, you will learn how to format Excel worksheets and cells in Microsoft Excel 2019. Raw data in Excel sheets is confusing, dull, and difficult to read and understand without formatting. To make data look more interesting and descriptive, formatting is often used. A good formatting method helps you to find meaning in the spreadsheet without the trouble of going through each and every individual cell. Cells with good formatting will draw your attention to the important cells automatically. There are various methods through which you can format the cells in Excel 2019 version, as mentioned below:

- Text wrapping and orientation

To make any changes in the format of the cell, there are some basic steps. In order to implement any formatting, select the cells that you want to format and right-click on the mouse. A few options will appear, as shown below, in the image:

## Text Wrapping and Orientation
The text wrapping and orientation feature helps to wrap text, so that it appears on multiple lines in a cell. You can either format the cell so the text will be wrapped automatically,or you can enter a line break manually. Data in the cell wraps to fit the column width; so, even if you change the column width, the data wrapping adjusts automatically. In the case where all the wrapped text is not visible, it may be because the row is set to a specific height or that the text is in a range of cells that has been merged. Orientation helps you to rotate your text up, down, counter-clockwise or clockwise, or align the text vertically, etc. 

You can follow the steps mentioned below for text wrapping:

- **Step One**: Select the cell(s) that you want to format.

- **Step Two**: Go to the Home tab, then in the Alignment group, click Wrap Text (pointed with red arrow) as shown below in the image:
